control battery care limiter and keyboard backlight on Sony Vaio pro laptops under Linux

It's basically a wrapper around some files in /sys/devices/platform/sony-laptop/ to controll the battery care limiter and the keyboard backlight on this laptop computer.
It's written in C, so you can use the SUID-Bit, if you want.
